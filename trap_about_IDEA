IDEA use built-in maven,sbt,and git

for git the ssh keys will be a minor problem: change to native

for maven: I give it up since no pom.xml will be seen if you add maven artifact through IDE

for sbt: you could use proxychains4 idea to make sbt use ss to connect, while git is disabled at this time
