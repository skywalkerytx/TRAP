In intellij, doobie.util.blablabla.Query0[A] will be recognized as Any

so the following code works fine but IDEA thinks there is some bug with it:

val q2 = sql"select 42".query[Int]

val p3 = q2.unique

the following helps:

val q2:Query0[Int] = sql"select 42".query[Int] //still red about `query[Int]`

val p3 = q2.unique //idea works from here


btw, issue is created to IDEA community but nothing happens since 2015.
