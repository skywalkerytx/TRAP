If you install cuda from apt source

REMEMBER to ln -s for /usr/loca/cuda, it's no more.

new location:
/usr/lib/x86-64* & /usr/include

and for mxnet default option:

in make/config.mk

USE_CUDA = 0

CUDA_PATH = NONE

USE_CUDNN = 0

USE_NVRTC = 0

remember to set it right

and even if you have libopencv-dev USE_OPENCV = 1 will crash you (a opencv version problem)

use ADD_LDFLAGS and ADD_CFLAGS to solve it

since i don't need opencv all is fine
